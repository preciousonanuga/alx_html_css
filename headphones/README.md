🌐 First Website Design from Scratch for Headphones

Welcome to my very first website design from scratch!
This project is a culmination of the foundational web development concepts I’ve learned so far — bringing together HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design — without using any external libraries or frameworks.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional, accessible, and responsive web page completely from scratch. That means:

No CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap)

No JavaScript libraries

No page builders or templates

Just pure HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on semantic structure, design best practices, and user accessibility.

🛠️ Key Features

✅ Clean and semantic HTML structure
✅ Custom CSS styling with no libraries
✅ Fully responsive layout — mobile-first approach
✅ Focus on accessibility (ARIA roles, color contrast, keyboard navigation)
✅ Consistent and modern UI design
✅ Designed and implemented from scratch

📱 Responsiveness

This site is built using responsive design principles:

Fluid layouts

Flexible images

Media queries for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Try resizing the browser or viewing on different devices!

♿ Accessibility

I’ve followed key accessibility guidelines:

Proper use of heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)

Alternative text for images

Keyboard-navigable structure

Use of landmarks and ARIA attributes where appropriate

Accessibility isn’t optional — it’s integral.

🧠 What I Learned

Structuring HTML for both content and accessibility

Writing efficient and scalable CSS

Creating responsive layouts with Flexbox/Grid

Debugging layout issues across devices

Designing user-centered experiences without relying on pre-built components
